# BUILD FILE: Explanation of build.gradle.kts

This document explains each line of the `build.gradle.kts` file for a minimal Kotlin Hello World project.

---

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.9.23"
    application
}
```
- **plugins**:  
  - `kotlin("jvm") version "1.9.23"`: Adds support for Kotlin on the JVM, required to compile Kotlin code.  
  - `application`: Adds tasks for running the app from the command line (`./gradlew run`). Not strictly required for compiling, but very convenient for running your app.

---

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
- **repositories**:  
  - `mavenCentral()`: Tells Gradle where to find dependencies. Even if you have no dependencies, this is standard and harmless to keep.

---

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // No dependencies needed for Hello World
}
```
- **dependencies**:  
  - Empty, which is fine for Hello World. If you add libraries later, you’ll list them here.

---

```kotlin
application {
    mainClass.set("MainKt")
}
```
- **application**:  
  - `mainClass.set("MainKt")`: Tells Gradle which class to run when you use `./gradlew run`.  
    - `"MainKt"` is the default name for a Kotlin file with a `main` function in a file named `Main.kt`.
    - If you remove the `application` plugin above, you can also remove this block.

---

```kotlin
java {
    toolchain {
        languageVersion.set(JavaLanguageVersion.of(21))
    }
}
```
- **java toolchain**:  
  - Ensures Gradle uses Java 21 to compile and run your code, regardless of your system’s default Java version.
  - Not strictly required for Hello World, but useful for consistency and avoiding version issues.

---

```kotlin
tasks.withType<org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.tasks.KotlinCompile> {
    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = "21"
    }
}
```
- **Kotlin compile options**:  
  - Sets the JVM bytecode target to Java 21.  
  - This should match the Java toolchain version above.  
  - If you remove the toolchain, you can set this to your system’s Java version, or omit it for default (but explicit is better).

---

## What could be dropped for a minimal Hello World?
- If you only want to compile (not run with `./gradlew run`), you can remove the `application` plugin and the `application { ... }` block.
- If you are fine with your system’s default Java version, you can remove the `java { toolchain ... }` block and the `jvmTarget` line (but this is not recommended for reproducibility).
- The `repositories` block is harmless and standard, even if empty.
- The `dependencies` block can’t be removed, but can remain empty.

---

**Summary:**  
Your current file is already quite minimal and practical. You can drop the `java { toolchain ... }` and `tasks.withType ...` blocks if you don’t care about Java version consistency, and the `application` plugin/block if you don’t need `./gradlew run`.
